# Execution Process in .NET

Understanding the execution process in .NET is crucial for .NET developers. This document provides an overview of how the .NET CLR handles the execution of programs, focusing on the compilation process and the role of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

## Compilation Process: From Source Code to MSIL

.NET applications start as source code written in any .NET-compatible language (like C#, F# or VB.NET). Here's how this code is transformed into a running application:

1. **Source Code to Intermediate Language (IL):** 
   - The source code is first compiled by its respective language compiler (e.g., csc.exe for C#) into an Intermediate Language (IL), which is a CPU-independent set of instructions.
   - The output is an assembly in the form of a `.dll` or `.exe` file containing this IL along with metadata.

2. **Assemblies:**
   - Assemblies are the building blocks of .NET applications. They include both executable application files and libraries. In addition to IL code, assemblies contain metadata that describes the types and resources in the assembly.

3. **Metadata:**
   - Metadata includes information about the types defined in the code, including their methods and properties, as well as information about external references.

## Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: MSIL to Native Code

When a .NET application is executed, the CLR takes over:

1. **Loading the Assembly:**
   - The CLR loads the assembly into the application domain.

2. **Converting IL to Native Code:**
   - The JIT compiler in the CLR converts the IL into native machine code. This conversion happens on a need-to-run basis; meaning, each method in the code is compiled just before it is called for the first time (JIT compilation).
   - The native code is then executed by the machine's CPU.

3. **Performance:**
   - JIT compilation ensures that the code is optimized for the specific hardware on which the application is running.
   - Native images, generated by the Native Image Generator (NGEN), can be used to skip JIT compilation by pre-compiling certain parts of the code.

## Assemblies and Application Domains

- **Application Domains:**
  - Application domains provide an isolated environment for running applications. Each application domain is loaded and executed separately, ensuring that applications do not affect each other.

- **Assembly Execution:**
  - When an assembly is executed, it is loaded into an application domain by the CLR. Dependencies are resolved, and the code is executed within this secure environment.
