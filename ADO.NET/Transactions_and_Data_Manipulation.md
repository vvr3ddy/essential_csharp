# Transactions and Data Manipulation in ADO.NET

Transactions are crucial in maintaining data integrity when performing multiple data manipulation operations in ADO.NET. This document explores how to manage transactions in ADO.NET and provides guidance on performing data manipulation operations such as insert, update, and delete.

### Understanding Transactions in ADO.NET

A transaction in ADO.NET is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction has only two outcomes: either all of the operations succeed (commit), or none of them do (rollback).

### Implementing Transactions

Transactions are implemented using the `SqlTransaction` or `OleDbTransaction` classes, depending on the type of database.

```csharp
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();
    SqlTransaction transaction = connection.BeginTransaction();

    try
    {
        SqlCommand command = connection.CreateCommand();
        command.Transaction = transaction;

        // Perform data manipulation operations here

        transaction.Commit();
    }
    catch
    {
        transaction.Rollback();
        throw;
    }
}
```

### Insert, Update, and Delete Operations

With ADO.NET, you can perform insert, update, and delete operations using the `SqlCommand` object.

- **Insert Operation:**
  ```csharp
  command.CommandText = "INSERT INTO YourTable (Column1, Column2) VALUES (Value1, Value2)";
  command.ExecuteNonQuery();
  ```

- **Update Operation:**
  ```csharp
  command.CommandText = "UPDATE YourTable SET Column1 = NewValue WHERE SomeCondition";
  command.ExecuteNonQuery();
  ```

- **Delete Operation:**
  ```csharp
  command.CommandText = "DELETE FROM YourTable WHERE SomeCondition";
  command.ExecuteNonQuery();
  ```

### Handling Transaction Isolation Levels

Isolation levels in transactions determine how data accessed by one transaction is isolated from other transactions. This is crucial for preventing problems like dirty reads, nonrepeatable reads, and phantom reads.

```csharp
transaction.IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted;
```

Managing transactions effectively is key to maintaining data integrity and consistency in database operations. ADO.NET provides comprehensive support for transactions, allowing for safe and reliable data manipulation in your applications.
