# Syntax and Lexical Conventions, Datatypes

This section explores the syntax and lexical conventions of C#, along with an overview of the various data types available in the language. Understanding these basics is foundational for any C# developer.

### [Basic Syntax and Structure of C# Code](./Basic_Syntax_and_Structure.md)

C# is a statically-typed, object-oriented language. Its syntax is highly expressive yet simple and easy to learn. In this section, we'll cover:

- The basic structure of a C# program.
- Understanding namespaces and `using` directives.
- Data type declaration and initialization.
- Control flow statements (if-else, switch, loops).
- Comments and documentation.

### [Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types](./Primitive_and_Non_Primitive_Datatypes.md)

C# provides a range of built-in data types. We'll explore:

- **Primitive Data Types:** 
  - Integral types (int, byte, long, etc.).
  - Floating-point types (float, double).
  - Boolean, char, and other basic types.

- **Non-Primitive Data Types:**
  - String and object types.
  - Composite types (arrays, enums, structs, and classes).

### [Value Types vs. Reference Types](./Value_and_Reference_Types.md)

Understanding the distinction between value types and reference types in C# is crucial for effective memory management and performance optimization.

- **Value Types:**
  - Stored directly in the memory stack.
  - Include primitive types (except `string` and `object`) and `struct`.
  - Examples and memory allocation behavior.

- **Reference Types:**
  - Stored in the heap with a reference pointer on the stack.
  - Includes `string`, `object`, and all class types.
  - Implications on memory management and garbage collection.
