# Multithreading in C#

Multithreading is a powerful feature in C# that allows multiple threads to run concurrently, enabling more efficient use of resources and improving application performance. This section explores the essentials of multithreading, from basic threading to advanced parallel programming concepts.

## Overview

### [Basics of Threading and Thread Class](./Basics_of_Threading_and_Thread_Class.md)

Threading in C# is managed using the `System.Threading` namespace. The `Thread` class is used to create and control threads.

- Creating threads using the `Thread` class.
- Managing thread lifecycle - starting, pausing, stopping threads.
- Understanding thread states and priorities.

### [Task Parallel Library (TPL)](./Task_Parallel_Library_TPL.md)

The Task Parallel Library (TPL) is a set of public types and APIs in the `System.Threading.Tasks` namespace. The TPL simplifies adding parallelism and concurrency to applications.

- Working with `Task` and `Task<T>` for creating and managing asynchronous operations.
- Using `Parallel` class for parallel loops and invocations.
- Handling exceptions and cancellation in TPL.

### [Synchronization and Thread Safety](./Synchronization_and_Thread_Safety.md)

In a multithreaded environment, ensuring thread safety and proper synchronization between threads is crucial to avoid issues like race conditions and deadlocks.

- Understanding critical sections and lock mechanism.
- Using synchronization primitives like `Mutex`, `Semaphore`, `Monitor`.
- Implementing concurrent collections.
