### Catching Specific Exceptions

Always catch specific exception types that you can handle. Catching more specific exceptions helps in dealing with the exact issue that has occurred.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    // Handle IO exceptions
}
catch (ArgumentNullException ex)
{
    // Handle argument null exceptions
}
```

### Avoiding General Exception Types

Avoid catching general exception types like `Exception` or `SystemException`, unless it is at the top level of your application to prevent crashes.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that might throw various exceptions
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log exception and provide a friendly error message to the user
}
```

### Throwing Informative Exceptions

When throwing exceptions, provide clear and detailed messages that explain the cause of the error. This makes debugging and logging more effective.

```csharp
if (fileSize > maxFileSize)
{
    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("fileSize", "The file size exceeds the allowed limit.");
}
```

### Using `finally` for Cleanup

Use `finally` blocks to clean up resources, such as files or network connections, regardless of whether an exception was thrown.

```csharp
FileStream file = null;
try
{
    file = File.Open("file.txt", FileMode.Open);
    // Work with the file
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    // Handle exceptions
}
finally
{
    file?.Close();
}
```

### Avoiding Exception Handling as Logic Flow

Do not use exceptions to control the flow of your application logic. Exceptions should be used only for exceptional, error conditions.

```csharp
// Avoid
try
{
    var value = dictionary["key"];
}
catch (KeyNotFoundException ex)
{
    // Exception should not be used to handle 'key not found' logic
}

// Prefer
if (dictionary.ContainsKey("key"))
{
    var value = dictionary["key"];
    // Use value
}
```
