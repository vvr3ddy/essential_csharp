# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in C# that allows for creating modular, reusable software components. This section covers the core principles of OOP in C#, including classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

## Overview

### [Classes and Objects](./Classes_and_Objects.md)

Classes are blueprints for creating objects (instances). They encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.

- Understanding class constructors, properties, and methods.
- Creating and interacting with objects.

### [Inheritance and Polymorphism](./Inheritance_and_Polymorphism.md)

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon.

- Implementing inheritance in class hierarchies.
- Using polymorphism through method overriding.

### [Encapsulation and Abstraction](./Encapsulation_and_Abstraction.md)

Encapsulation involves bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within one unit. Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

- Creating private fields and public properties.
- Abstracting complex functionalities behind simple interfaces.

### [Interfaces and Abstract Classes](./Interfaces_and_Abstract_Classes.md)

Interfaces and abstract classes allow for creating flexible and reusable code. They define 'contracts' that implementing classes must adhere to.

- Defining and implementing interfaces.
- Creating and using abstract classes.

Understanding these OOP concepts is crucial for designing robust, scalable, and maintainable C# applications. This section explores each concept in detail, providing the foundational knowledge needed to build complex C# applications.
