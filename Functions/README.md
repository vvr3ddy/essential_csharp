# Functions in C#

Functions are fundamental building blocks in C# programming. They encapsulate reusable code, making programs more modular, readable, and maintainable. This section delves into the various aspects of using functions in C#.

## Overview

### [Defining and Invoking Functions](./Defining_Invoking.md)

Functions in C# are declared within a class or struct. A typical function includes a return type, a name, parameters, and a body. Functions can be invoked or called to perform their designated task and possibly return a value.

- Basic structure of a function.
- How to call or invoke a function.
- Void functions vs. functions that return a value.

### [Parameters, Return Types, and Overloading](./Parameters_ReturnTypes_Overloading.md)

Parameters allow passing data to functions, and return types specify the type of data a function returns. Function overloading enables defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

- Different types of parameters: value, reference, and output.
- Understanding return types and their importance.
- Function overloading: creating functions with the same name but different signatures.

### [Extension Methods](./Extension_Methods.md)

Extension methods provide a way to add new methods to existing types without altering the original type's code.

- Creating extension methods.
- Usage and benefits of extension methods.
- Rules and best practices for extension methods.

Each of these areas plays a critical role in effective C# programming. Proper use of functions can lead to code that is more efficient, readable, and easier to debug and maintain.
